# 2d_ascii_shooter
This is my attempt to build a game using c++ and only ascii graphics. Currently you can use wasd to move and f to fire a projectile. While
this project seems initially very simple, it utilizes more advanced concepts such as concurent programming as the graphics are buffered to allow
for the current frame to be drawn and the next to be generated.

## Upcoming features: ##
<br> -New user-input system <br />
<br>              Currently taking in user-input only allows for one button to be pressed at a time. Most likely switching over to a <br/>
<br>              more robust approach by reading the keyboard events rather than using stdin for user input <br />
<br> -Multiplayer <br />
<br>              Use UDP client/server to connect two players <br />
<br> -Enemy projectiles <br />
<br> -Sound <br />
<br> -Levels <br />
